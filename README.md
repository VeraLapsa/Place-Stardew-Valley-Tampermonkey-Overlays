*To Use the Scipt for other things* 
- This script can do tranparent pngs and can have multilple versions of it running as long as you change the name of the script.
- There's a `TEMPLATE` varible on the 16th line that contains the url of the image you want to overlay. Make sure it's the same size you want it on the canvas.
- Also if you change use a different image domain, I use Imgur, change the `// @connect      imgur.com` to what ever domain your using.
- The Coords for where the overlay will be placed are in on the 18th line, with the in an `[X,Y]` style.
